/// Nested processing of Chromium tasks is disabled by default because common

/// where the stack is reentrancy safe and processing nestable tasks is
/// explicitly safe. Do not use in cases (like the printer example) where an OS
/// API may experience unplanned reentrancy as a result of a new task executing
/// immediately.
///
/// For instance,
/// - The UI thread is running a message loop.
/// - It receives a task #1 and executes it.
/// - The task #1 implicitly starts a nested message loop. For example, via
///   Windows APIs such as MessageBox or GetSaveFileName, or default handling
///   of a user-initiated drag/resize operation (e.g. DefWindowProc handling of
///   WM_SYSCOMMAND for SC_MOVE/SC_SIZE).
/// - The UI thread receives a task #2 before or while in this second message
///   loop.
/// - With NestableTasksAllowed set to true, the task #2 will run right away.
///   Otherwise, it will be executed right after task #1 completes at "thread
///   message loop level".
